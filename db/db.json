A study that tested people’s cells by damaging them with peroxide, showed that those who supplemented with kiwi showed an improved ability of the DNA to repair itself after applying the peroxide. This means that kiwi might help prevent long-term cancers and lifestyle diseases such as colon cancer, which is closely linked to DNA damage. "

Manganese may help stave off osteoporosis and helps improve overall bone and mineral density, according to Oregon State University. Be careful not to overdo it, though — manganese intake can be dangerous and may increase the risk of cognitive disorders if you consume more than 11 mg per day, according to a study published in The Open Orthopaedics Journal. But don’t fret: It’d be difficult to reach those levels because ½ cup pineapple has less than 1 mg manganese, Andrews says."
